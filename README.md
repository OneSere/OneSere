Iâ€™m Abhishek Choudhary, a Jaipur-based photographer, developer, and human behavior observer with a passion for building thoughtful digital experiences.
With a multidisciplinary background, I bring together technology, creativity, and market insight to develop tools, content, and strategies that solve real problems. Iâ€™ve worked across startups, created multiple mini projects, and received national recognition for innovation in both mental health and visual storytelling.
ðŸ§  I'm deeply interested in how humans behave, react, and express â€” and I often channel this into my Python-based tools, emotion-detection systems, and AI projects.
ðŸ“¸ As a photographer and story-filmmaker, I craft visuals that speak â€” combining art, light, and emotion.
ðŸ“ˆ On the analytical side, I actively engage in stock market research, tracking trends and behavioral patterns to predict outcomes.
